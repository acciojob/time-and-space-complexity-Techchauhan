	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of how the runtime of an algorithm scales with the size of the input. Efficient algorithms are designed to minimize time complexity to perform better with larger datasets.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses during its execution. It is typically expressed using Big-O notation, such as O(n), which indicates the relationship between the input size and the memory usage.</p>
